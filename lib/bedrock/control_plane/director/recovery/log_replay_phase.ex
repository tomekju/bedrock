defmodule Bedrock.ControlPlane.Director.Recovery.LogReplayPhase do
  @moduledoc """
  Migrates the active transaction window from old logs to newly recruited log configuration.

  Solves the critical data migration challenge of transferring the current window of committed
  transactions to known-good storage. Since recovery must read old logs anyway to verify what's
  recoverable, it duplicates that data to new logs rather than trusting potentially corrupted
  or failing storage. This ensures storage servers can continue processing from reliable storage.

  **Migration Strategy (Consistent Hashing)**: With consistent hashing, shard→log mapping is
  computed at runtime. Each new log receives the full list of survivors (old logs that were
  locked) and can pull transactions from any of them. The log's personalized transaction
  stream is reconstructed by pulling from survivors and filtering by shard index.

  For initial recovery (no old logs), each new log is initialized with an empty transaction
  stream at version zero.

  **Service Access**: All log services (old and new) are locked by this point in recovery,
  so the phase simply retrieves their PIDs from the `service_pids` map using `Map.fetch!`
  to enforce that all required services must be available.

  **Data Integrity**: Only copies committed transactions within the established version
  vector (the active window), discarding uncommitted transactions that lack durability
  guarantees. Maintains transaction ordering and ensures storage servers can continue
  processing seamlessly in the new configuration.

  Stalls with detailed failure information if log copying fails due to service issues.
  However, immediately halts with error if any log reports `:newer_epoch_exists` (this
  director has been superseded). Transitions to sequencer startup with complete migration.
